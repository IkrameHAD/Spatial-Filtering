# Spatial-Filtering
In this lab we will practice the general principles of spatial filtering. Starting from a mean kernel filter we will build up to create and apply Gaussian and derivative filters. Then, we will break the some of the assumptions of linear filtering, when creating a bilinear filtering and looking for Waldo (Charlie)
